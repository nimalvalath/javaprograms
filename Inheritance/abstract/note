Abstract class
An abstract class is a class that is declared abstractâ€”it may or may not include abstract methods. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, but they can be subclassed.

We create abstract class only to inherit in one or other class.+
We can not instantiate an abstract class just like we can not instantiate an interface. If you are not inheriting the abstract class then there is no point in having it.+
Below is the example of inheriting the abstract class and calling the concrete method through an instance of child class where concrete method is defined in parent.

More important points about abstract class :+
If any one method is abstract in a class then class must be declared abstract.
An abstract class can have data members just like concrete class.
An abstract class do contains a constructor but it can not be instantiated, it can only be inherited.
A class which inherits the abstract class should provide implementations to all the abstract methods unless it is also abstract.
A class which inherits the abstract class can override the concrete methods as well.
